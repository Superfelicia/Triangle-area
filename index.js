// FIRST ASSIGNMENT

// Calculate the area of two triangles
// Compare the values of the result to see which one has the biggest area
// Code one example for each test data that you are provided
// One case (code example) for the first test data, one for the second and so on.
// Use template literals to output the result to the console


// Formula for calculating the area of a triangle:
// area = (base * height) /2

// OBS! In this case you actually have to use the parentheses
// when doing the area calculation.
// Answer the question why JavaScript needs the parentheses in this
// case? You can put your answer as plain text when you hand in the
// assignment.


// TEST DATA
// Case 1
// triangleOne: base = 10cm, height = 13cm
// triangleTwo: base = 16,5cm, height = 20,3cm

// Case 2
// triangleTwo: base = 16,5cm, height = 20,3cm
// triangleTwo: base = 20,3cm, height = 16,5cm

// Case 3
// triangleTwo: base = 7,8cm, height = 5,6cm
// triangleTwo: base = 9,3cm, height = 12,4cm

// Print the total area for each triangle together with the result of which
// one that has the biggest are. 
// Example: `Triangle One has an bigger area of xx cm2 and Triangle Two has
// an area of xx cm2. The triangle with the biggest area is Triangle xx.`

// Code an example for each case of test data.
// Hand in a link to your GitHub repo for your assignment and don't
// forget to answer the question above.




// 1. Make sure I know how to calculate the area of a triangle
// 2. Calculate one triangles are and make sure the formula works and the
// correct result shows in the console.
// 3. Compare both results and output it to the console. Make sure to output
// which one that has the biggest area. 
// 4.
